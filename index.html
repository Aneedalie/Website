                        <em><strong>Hey! It's Tammy.</strong></em>
                        <br/><br/>I'm an experienced full stack developer with a background in traditional and graphic design. My <strong><a href="resume-tammy.pdf">resume</a></strong> describes some of my previous experiences much better.
                        I also study Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada. 
                        <br/><br/>Right now I'm mostly interested in game dev and security, and honestly anything that you can convince me is cool.

            <h3>What am I up to right now?</h3>
            <p>
                I'm finishing up my Software Engineering degree and graduating in 2019, which means lots of schoolwork. I like exploring exciting stuff! Think along the lines of martial arts and crytography and learning about birds of prey.
                <br/><br/>
                <em>My major project focus is currently my <a href="https://github.com/calder-gl/calder">design project focused on WebGL</a> and making that more accessible, and a 3-piece fantasy landscape painting. Ask me about it, or anything really! :)</em>

           <h5>@Menlo Park, USA</h5>
            <p>
                I was at Facebook as a software engineer on the Data Privacy team, with a focus on GDPR and regulations compliance. Most of the details are <em>hush hush</em> but it was an exciting time! I met lots of interesting people that helped me grow as a person and worked on several privacy-related projects.
            </p>
           <h5>@San Francisco, USA</h5>
            <p>
                I worked at <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a> as a mobile engineer on the iOS team. During this time I built their user profile pages for iOS, and spearheaded initial accessibility work with my mentor by implementing best practices and improving VoiceOver for the app. I also worked on some other iOS features, better detailed in this blog post <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2017/09/asana-ipad-app-iphone-updates/">announcing Asana for iOS 11</a>.
            </p>
            <h5>@Singapore</h5>
            <p>
                I was working as a Data Science Research Assistant for the StackUp, National University of Singapore (NUS). More specifically I was working on developing a course on data science with a focus on machine learning. I also helped create course content for a course called "Connect Using APIs". These courses target mature students whose goal is to create their own startup or switch careers.
            </p>
            <h5>@Waterloo, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                I recently finished my grueling 2nd year at the University of Waterloo. This means I am officially a third year now (and am starting to feel old).
                <br/>
                I was also working along with a team of awesome people to organize a hackathon/learnathon event for high school students called <a href="http://techretreat.ca/">Tech Retreat</a>. Unfortunately, due to funding difficulties we were not able to hold our event for 2016. The memory of TR2015 lives on in us.
            </p >
            <h5>@Stockholm, Sweden</h5>
            <p>
                I was on a trip to to participate in <a href="http://www.icra2016.org/">ICRA 2016</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www.uwnrg.org">UW NanoRobotics Group</a>. We won 1st place in the Microrobotics Microassembly challenge!
            </p>
            <h5>@Vancouver, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                From January to April I was working at 
                <a href="https://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite Media Inc.</a>, Vancouver on their Internal Platform team.
                During my work term I wrote a blog post on <a href="http://code.hootsuite.com/monolith-to-microservices/">Monoliths to Microservices</a>!
