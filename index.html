            <h3>What am I up to right now?</h3>
            <p>
                I am in my 3A term of Software Engineering at UW, which means lots of schoolwork. It also means I am seeking an internship role for summer 2017. I am trying to explore some new interests, like ballroom dancing, while focusing on my existing commitments, like archery and nanorobotics.

           <h3>Previously...</h3>
            <h5>@Singapore</h5>
            <p>
                I was working as a Data Science Research Assistant for the StackUp, National University of Singapore (NUS). More specifically I was working on developing a course on data science with a focus on machine learning. I also helped create course content for a course called "Connect Using APIs". These courses target mature students whose goal is to create their own startup or switch careers.
            </p>
            <h5>@Waterloo, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                I recently finished my grueling 2B term at the University of Waterloo. This means I am officially a third year now (and am starting to feel old).
                <br/>
                I was also working along with a team of awesome people to organize a hackathon/learnathon event for high school students called <a href="http://techretreat.ca/">Tech Retreat</a>. Unfortunately, due to funding difficulties we were not able to hold our event for 2016. The memory of TR2015 lives on in us.
            </p >
            <h5>@Stockholm, Sweden</h5>
            <p>
                I was on a trip to to participate in <a href="http://www.icra2016.org/">ICRA 2016</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www.uwnrg.org">UW NanoRobotics Group</a>. We won first place in the Microrobotics Microassembly challenge!
            </p>
            <h5>@Vancouver, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                From January to April I was working at 
                <a href="https://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite Media Inc.</a>, Vancouver on their Internal Platform team.
                During my work term I wrote a blog post on <a href="http://code.hootsuite.com/monolith-to-microservices/">Monoliths to Microservices</a>!
