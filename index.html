            <p>
                Currently I am working as a Data Science Research Assistant for the National University of Singapore (NUS). More specifically I'm working on developing a course on data science with a focus on machine learning.

            <h5>@Waterloo</h5>
            <p>
                I recently finished my grueling 2B term at the University of Waterloo. This means I am officially a third year now (and am starting to feel old).
                <br/>
                I was also working along with a team of awesome people to organize a hackathon/learnathon event for high school students called <a href="http://techretreat.ca/">Tech Retreat</a>. Unfortunately, due to funding issues we were not able to hold our event. We haven't given up though, so feel free to ask me about it!
            </p >
            <h5>@Stockholm</h5>
            <p>
                I was on a trip to Stockholm, Sweden to participate in <a href="http://www.icra2016.org/">ICRA 2016</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www.uwnrg.org">UW NanoRobotics Group</a>. We won first place in the Microrobotics Microassembly challenge!
            </p>
            <h5>@Vancouver</h5>
            <p>
                From January to April I was working at 
                <a href="https://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite Media Inc.</a>, Vancouver on their Internal Platform team.
                During my work term I wrote a blog post on <a href="http://code.hootsuite.com/monolith-to-microservices/">Monoliths to Microservices</a>!
