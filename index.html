            <h3>What am I up to right now?</h3>
            <p>
                I'm currently working as a product engineer at Asana in New York City. When I'm not neck deep in thinking about the product, I like to unwind by playing video games and partaking in some of my hobbies at home!

           <h5>2014 - 2019 @Waterloo, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                I graduated the University of Waterloo in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Software Engineering and a minor in Cognitive Science. It's been an adventure to move between school terms and co-op terms, but the experience has been like none other. During my time in Waterloo, I worked on some pretty awesome teams and managed to create some cool stuff.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was working along with a team of awesome people to organize a hackathon/learnathon event for high school students called <a href="http://techretreat.ca/">Tech Retreat</a>. Unfortunately, due to funding difficulties we were not able to hold our event for 2016. The memory of TR2015 lives on in us.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For my capstone project, we focused on making a framework to inversely procedural generate 3D models based on Beizier curves called <a href="https://github.com/calder-gl/calder">Calder</a>. It was a team effort that helped us get a paper published at Graphics Interface 2019, and also won one of the best in research amongst the projects in our class.
            </p>
            </p>
           <h5>Winter 2018 @Menlo Park, USA</h5>
            <p>
                I was at Facebook as a software engineer intern on the Data Privacy team, with a focus on GDPR and regulations compliance. Most of the details are <em>hush hush</em> but it was an exciting time! I met lots of interesting people that helped me grow as a person and worked on several privacy-related projects.
            </p>
           <h5>Summer 2017 @San Francisco, USA</h5>
            <p>
                I worked at Asana as a mobile engineer intern on the iOS team. During this time I built their user profile pages for iOS, and spearheaded initial accessibility work with my mentor by implementing best practices and improving VoiceOver for the app. I also worked on some other iOS features, better detailed in this blog post <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2017/09/asana-ipad-app-iphone-updates/">announcing Asana for iOS 11</a>.
            </p>
            <h5>Winter 2017 @Singapore</h5>
            <p>
                I was working as a data science research assistant intern for the StackUp, National University of Singapore (NUS). More specifically I was working on developing a course on data science with a focus on machine learning. I also helped create course content for a course called "Connect Using APIs". These courses target mature students whose goal is to create their own startup or switch careers.
            </p>
            <h5>Summer 2016 @Stockholm, Sweden</h5>
            <p>
                I was on a trip to to participate in <a href="http://www.icra2016.org/">ICRA 2016</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www.uwnrg.org">UW NanoRobotics Group</a>. We won 1st place in the Microrobotics Microassembly challenge!
            </p>
            <h5>Winter 2016 @Vancouver, Canada</h5>
            <p>
                I was interning at Hootsuite Media, Vancouver on their Internal Platform team.
                During my work term I wrote a blog post on Monoliths to Microservices (that is no longer hosted on their website).
